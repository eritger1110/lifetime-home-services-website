  <h1>Floor Coatings</h1>
  <p>Our two-part system starts with a sturdy epoxy base that bonds to concrete. We then apply a polyaspartic top coat that cures quickly and resists UV damage.</p>
  <p>The result is a glossy, easy-to-clean surface perfect for garages, basements, and workshops. Decorative flakes add grip and style.</p>
  <p>With professional installation, you can walk on your new floor in hours and park vehicles the next day.</p>
