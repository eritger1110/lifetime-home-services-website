        <h2>What is Radon?</h2>
        <p>Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is invisible, odorless, and tasteless. It is released from the normal decay of uranium, thorium, and radium in rocks and soil. Radon can seep into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation, and can accumulate to dangerous levels. The EPA estimates that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States, responsible for over 21,000 deaths each year.</p>
        
        <h3>Why is Radon Testing Important?</h3>
        <p>Because you can’t see or smell radon, testing is the only way to know if your home has elevated levels. The EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes below the third floor for radon. A simple and inexpensive test can determine if your home has a high level of radon and if you need to take action to protect your family.</p>

        <h3>Our Radon Testing Process</h3>
        <p>We use state-of-the-art continuous radon monitors to provide accurate, reliable results. Our testing process is simple and non-invasive:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> We discuss your home’s layout and identify the best location for the test.</li>
          <li><strong>Placement:</strong> A certified technician places a continuous radon monitor in the lowest livable level of your home.</li>
          <li><strong>Testing Period:</strong> The monitor remains in your home for a minimum of 48 hours to collect data.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis & Report:</strong> We analyze the data and provide you with a detailed report of the radon levels in your home.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Radon Mitigation Systems</h3>
        <p>If your home has elevated radon levels, we can install a custom mitigation system to reduce radon to safe levels. Our certified technicians will design and install a system that is effective and aesthetically pleasing. Most radon reduction systems include a vent pipe and fan, which pull radon from beneath the house and vent it to the outside. Our systems are guaranteed to reduce radon levels to below the EPA action level of 4.0 pCi/L.</p>

  {
    question: "What is a safe level of radon?",
    answer: "The EPA recommends that you take action to reduce your home’s radon levels if your test result is 4.0 pCi/L or higher. However, there is no known safe level of radon, and the EPA also recommends considering mitigation for levels between 2.0 and 4.0 pCi/L."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I test my home for radon?",
    answer: "The EPA recommends testing your home for radon every two years, and after any major renovations, such as finishing a basement or adding an extension."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a radon mitigation system installation take?",
    answer: "Most radon mitigation systems can be installed in just one day. Our certified technicians will work efficiently to minimize disruption to your daily routine."
