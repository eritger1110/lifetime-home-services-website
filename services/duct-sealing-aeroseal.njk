        <h2>What is Aeroseal?</h2>
        <p>Aeroseal is a patented technology that seals ductwork from the inside. The process involves pressurizing the duct system and injecting a non-toxic, aerosolized sealant into the ducts. The sealant particles are drawn to leaks and build up to seal them, without coating the inside of the ducts. This innovative process is more effective than traditional duct sealing methods and can seal leaks in even the most inaccessible areas of your ductwork.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Aeroseal Duct Sealing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Energy Savings:</strong> Reduce your heating and cooling costs by up to 30%.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Comfort:</strong> Eliminate hot and cold spots for more even temperatures throughout your home.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Air Quality:</strong> Prevent dust, allergens, and other pollutants from entering your ductwork and circulating in your home.</li>
          <li><strong>Increased HVAC System Lifespan:</strong> A properly sealed duct system reduces the strain on your HVAC equipment, extending its life.</li>
        </ul>
