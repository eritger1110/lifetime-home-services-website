        <h2>Why is Duct Cleaning Important?</h2>
        <p>Over time, your home’s ductwork can accumulate dust, debris, pet dander, and other allergens. These contaminants are then circulated throughout your home every time your HVAC system runs, contributing to poor indoor air quality and potential health issues. Professional duct cleaning removes these contaminants, improving the air you breathe and the efficiency of your HVAC system.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Duct Cleaning</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Improved Indoor Air Quality:</strong> Remove dust, allergens, and other contaminants for cleaner, healthier air.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced HVAC Efficiency:</strong> Clean ducts allow your HVAC system to run more efficiently, saving you money on energy bills.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Allergens and Irritants:</strong> Alleviate allergy and asthma symptoms by removing triggers from your air ducts.</li>
          <li><strong>Odor Removal:</strong> Eliminate musty smells and other odors caused by contaminants in your ductwork.</li>
        </ul>
